Confusion Matrix

A Confusion Matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted labels with actual labels.

True Positive (TP): Correctly predicted positive

True Negative (TN): Correctly predicted negative

False Positive (FP): Incorrectly predicted positive

False Negative (FN): Incorrectly predicted negative

It helps calculate metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

inear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous value.

Models the relationship between input and output using a straight line

Equation: y = mx + c

Used for predicting prices, marks, sales, etc.

Simple, fast, and easy to interpret.

 Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used for binary outcomes (0 or 1).

Uses the sigmoid function to convert output into probability

Commonly used for spam detection, disease prediction, pass/fail systems

Output is a probability between 0 and 1

Despite its name, it is used for classification, not regression.

 Decision Tree

A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.

Works like a flowchart with nodes and branches

Splits data based on conditions to make decisions

Easy to visualize and understand

Used in recommendation systems, credit scoring, and medical diagnosis.
